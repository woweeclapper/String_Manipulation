# This was an old string manipulation Java 14 project written on Netbean IDE with a Maven Structure

Its original purpose was asking the user to input through the console UI.
It asked the user to input a string or elements based on the service they want.
Reverse and Shift ask for string as input as well as additional parameter for shifted.
Sort and Sum ask for an array of elements after verifying the length the user want and each element must be inputted.
Small amount of input validations was implemented, but it was merely a final project for a class.

## Goals and Rough Designs for this Project

- Update from Java 14 to Java 25
- Refactoring current project into a functional Backend
- Frontend will be design in vanilla html/css/js
- Spring Boot will be implemented into Backend once refactoring is done

## Hosting
- GitHub Pages for Frontend
- Render for Backend
- Docker is needed for Render hosting since it does not support Java
