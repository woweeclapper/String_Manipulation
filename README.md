# This was an old string manipulation Java 14 project written on Netbean with a Maven Gradle Structure
## Goals and Rough Designs for this Project

- Update from Java 14 to Java 25
- Refactoring current project into a functional Backend
- Frontend will be design in vanilla html/cc/js
- Spring Boot will be implemented into Backend once refactoring is done

## Hosting
- Github Pages for Frontend
- Render for Backend
- Docker is needed for Render hosting since it does not support Java
